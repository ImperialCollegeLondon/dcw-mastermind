Once upon a time, there was a popular commercial game, marketed in the UK
at least by Invicta, called Mastermind.  This was unrelated to the TV
quiz with the black chair, specialist subjects etc etc.

In this two player game, one player choses a secret code of colours (possibly
repeated) such as Red-Green-Red-Blue-Yellow, while the other tries to guess
that secret code of colours as quickly as possible.

This directory contains my original (December 2000) version of the Mastermind
Game, written in ISO C, using low level X-Windows (Xlib) graphics to present
the user interface.

Here, the computer chooses the secret code, while the human attempts
to guess it.  Each go, the computer marks the human's guess against the
secret code, awarding it a score made up of "B blacks and W whites":

A black peg indicates that one of the guessed colours is exactly right (the
right colour in the right position); but doesn't tell you which one.

A white peg indicates that one of the guessed colours is contained in the
secret code, but not in the correct position.

The human's task is, of course, to guess the secret code as quickly as
possible.  The best strategy involves finding a new guess that is
consistent with all previous guesses and their scores.
